# DRIIVA Technical Roadmap
### MVP Beta -- February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Driiva is a telematics-based insurance platform that tracks driving behaviour via GPS, calculates a personalised driving score, and uses that score to offer fairer insurance premiums. Safe drivers pay less and earn refunds from a community pool.

This document provides a complete picture of what has been built, what was updated in the latest sprint, and what remains before the product meets industry standard for a regulated insurtech beta.

## Latest Sprint Updates (February 2026)

These changes were made in the current development cycle:

### 1. Cloud Functions Build Fixed
**What:** Two code errors were preventing the entire backend from being deployed to Firebase. Both are now fixed and the backend compiles cleanly.

**Why it matters:** Without this fix, no trip processing, no scoring, no AI analysis, and no pool calculations would work in production. This was the single biggest blocker.

### 2. Trips Page Wired to Real Data
**What:** The "Recent Trips" screen was previously showing 4 fake/demo trips. It now pulls real trip data from Firestore -- the actual database.

**Why it matters:** Users will see their real driving history with real scores, distances, and event counts. Previously it was a static mockup.

### 3. AI Insights Feature Flag
**What:** Added an on/off switch for the AI coaching feature. It can be disabled with a single environment variable (`FEATURE_AI_INSIGHTS=false`).

**Why it matters:** AI analysis costs money per trip (Anthropic API usage). During beta, this lets us control spend. It also means if the AI service has issues, we can turn it off without redeploying code.

**Where the flag lives:**
- Client side: `VITE_FEATURE_AI_INSIGHTS` in `.env`
- Server side: `FEATURE_AI_INSIGHTS` in Cloud Functions environment

### 4. Root Platform Insurance Integration
**What:** Built the connection between Driiva and Root Platform (rootplatform.com), which is an insurance infrastructure API. Three new Cloud Functions:
- **Get Quote** -- sends driving score to Root, gets back a premium price
- **Accept Quote** -- binds a policy through Root's system
- **Sync Policy** -- keeps our records up to date with Root's

**Why it matters:** This is how Driiva will actually issue real insurance policies. Root handles the regulatory/underwriting side; we provide the telematics data and scores.

**What's needed:** Root Platform partner agreement and API credentials (sandbox key for testing, production key for launch).

## What's NOT Done Yet (Gaps to Close)

### CRITICAL -- Must Have Before Any Beta Users

| Gap | Risk | Effort | Detail |
|-----|------|--------|--------|
| Firebase deployment | **Blocking** | 1 hour | Cloud Functions, security rules, and indexes need to be deployed. Requires `firebase login` and deploy commands. |
| Anthropic API key | **Blocking** | 15 min | Need to create an account at console.anthropic.com, generate a key, and set it as a Firebase secret. Without this, AI trip coaching won't work. |
| Root Platform credentials | **Blocking** | Business | Need to sign partner agreement with Root Platform and obtain sandbox API key. Without this, insurance quotes/policies won't work. |
| Automated testing | **Critical** | 2-3 weeks | Zero automated tests exist. No unit tests, no integration tests, no end-to-end tests. Industry standard for fintech is 80%+ code coverage. |
| CI/CD pipeline | **Critical** | 1 week | No automated deployment pipeline. Every release requires manual commands. Need GitHub Actions to run tests, build, and deploy automatically. |
| Error monitoring | **Critical** | 2 days | No Sentry, no DataDog, no error tracking. If the app crashes for users, we won't know until they tell us. |
| Password reset | **Critical** | 1 day | Users cannot reset forgotten passwords. Basic auth feature that's missing. |

### HIGH PRIORITY -- Must Have Before Public Beta

| Gap | Risk | Effort | Detail |
|-----|------|--------|--------|
| Stripe payment processing | **High** | 1-2 weeks | Stripe dependencies are installed but no payment endpoints are built. Users can't actually pay premiums yet. |
| Push notifications | **High** | 3-5 days | Token storage exists but no notification sending logic. Users won't get alerts about trip scores, policy updates, etc. |
| Analytics | **High** | 2-3 days | Firebase Analytics dependency exists but isn't initialised. We can't measure user behaviour, retention, or feature usage. |
| Service worker (offline) | **High** | 3-5 days | PWA manifest exists but no service worker. App won't work offline or be installable on mobile home screens. |
| CORS lockdown | **High** | 1 hour | Server currently accepts requests from any website (`*`). Must restrict to driiva.com and localhost only. |
| Content Security Policy | **High** | 1 day | No CSP headers. Leaves the app vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. |
| Email verification | **Medium** | 1-2 days | Users can sign up with any email without verifying they own it. |

### MEDIUM PRIORITY -- Should Have for Credibility

| Gap | Risk | Effort | Detail |
|-----|------|--------|--------|
| Phone usage detection | **Medium** | 1-2 weeks | Score component exists but always returns 100. Need actual phone pickup detection. |
| Trip route visualisation | **Medium** | 3-5 days | Map shows current location but doesn't draw the route line for completed trips. |
| Achievements backend | **Medium** | 1 week | Achievement UI exists with demo data. Backend logic to unlock/track achievements not implemented. |
| Rewards system | **Medium** | 1-2 weeks | Rewards page is entirely mock data. No points economy or reward claiming. |
| Profile page data | **Medium** | 2-3 days | Profile page shows static placeholder data instead of real user info. |
| Documentation | **Medium** | 1 week | No README, no architecture document, no API docs. |

## Industry Standard Checklist (Insurtech / Fintech)

For a product handling personal driving data and insurance premiums, these are the regulatory and industry requirements:

### Regulatory Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| FCA registration | Not started | Financial Conduct Authority approval needed to sell insurance in the UK. Can operate under Root Platform's licence initially. |
| UK GDPR compliance | Partial | Privacy policy exists, data export & deletion work. Need cookie consent banner, data processing records, and DPO appointment. |
| ICO registration | Not started | Must register with the Information Commissioner's Office as a data controller. |
| PCI DSS | Not applicable yet | Not handling card data directly (Stripe handles it). If we ever handle card numbers, this becomes mandatory. |

### Security (Pre-Launch Audit)

| Requirement | Status | Priority |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Penetration testing | Not done | **Must do** before public beta |
| Security audit (code) | Not done | **Must do** before public beta |
| Data encryption at rest | Covered by Firebase | Firestore encrypts at rest by default |
| Data encryption in transit | Covered by HTTPS | All Firebase services use TLS |
| API key restrictions | Documented | Firebase key restricted, but need to verify in GCP console |
| Secret management | Partial | Using Firebase secrets, but Anthropic key not yet set |
| Rate limiting | Exists | Auth: 5/15min, API: 100/15min, Webhooks: 10/min |
| Input sanitisation | Exists | Strips HTML tags, trims inputs |
| SQL injection | Not applicable | Using Firestore (NoSQL), not SQL |

### Operational Readiness

| Requirement | Status | Priority |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Uptime monitoring | UptimeRobot pinging /health | 99.9% SLA target |

**Uptime monitoring:** The `health` Cloud Function exposes a public GET endpoint for external pingers. URL after deploy: `https://<region>-<project-id>.cloudfunctions.net/health`. Configure UptimeRobot (or similar) to hit this URL every 5 minutes; 200 = healthy, 503 = unhealthy (e.g. Firestore unreachable).
| Error alerting | Not set up | Need PagerDuty or similar for on-call |
| Database backups | Automatic (Firebase) | Firestore handles backups |
| Disaster recovery plan | Not documented | Need documented DR procedures |
| Load testing | Not done | Must test with expected user volumes |
| Staging environment | Not set up | Need separate Firebase project for staging |
