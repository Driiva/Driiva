Role: Same role: senior mobile UI/UX designer and frontend engineer. Now focus only on the sign-in screen visuals, not the auth logic.
Goal: Make the sign-in screen look and feel as polished as the TYPE B sign-in/dashboard designs, while keeping the Supabase login behaviour exactly as-is.
Visual references:


TYPE B sign-in and dashboard screenshots show clean glassmorphism, tight spacing, and clear hierarchy.


TYPE A/C sign-in screenshot shows current issues: awkward spacing, potential cropping, and a prominent “Log in failed!” state.


1. Layout and spacing


Center the sign-in card vertically on mobile in a way that feels similar to the dashboard card spacing in TYPE B.


Reduce excess top/bottom padding inside the card so the form feels tight and focused without being cramped.


Ensure consistent margins from card edges to fields, button, and error banner.


2. Inputs, labels, and error banner


Align labels, input fields, and icons so they form a clean vertical rhythm.


Ensure border radius, border color, and font sizes match the overall system (dashboard, hero, etc.).


Style the “Log in failed!” error banner to look intentional:


Clear icon + text.


Full-width across the card with consistent padding.


Color and intensity similar to a subtle error state in a modern fintech app (not overly aggressive).




3. Cropping and readability


Fix any cropped content (icons cut off, text touching edges) by adjusting container heights and padding.


Do NOT fix this by simply shrinking fonts too small; maintain readability comparable to “Alex Driver” text in TYPE B.


4. Files


Modify the sign-in page component and any associated styles (e.g. signin.tsx and its CSS/Tailwind).


Constraints:


Do NOT alter Supabase/auth logic, login endpoints, or redirect rules. Only visual styling and layout.


Output:


List the files changed.


Describe how the updated sign-in screen now matches TYPE B for spacing, card style, and hierarchy, while preserving the same login behaviour.
