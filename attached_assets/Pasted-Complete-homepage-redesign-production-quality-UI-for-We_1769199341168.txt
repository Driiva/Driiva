Complete homepage redesign - production quality UI for Welcome page

LOGO & ASSET:
- Replace current logo with 'driiva-logo-CLEAR-FINAL.jpg' from project assets
- Logo width: 320px, centered horizontally
- Position logo with minimal top padding (40px from viewport top)
- Remove ALL old logo assets and references

LAYOUT & SPACING:
- Reduce top padding drastically - logo starts at 40px from top
- Vertically center ALL content to fit viewport without scrolling on mobile
- Component order top to bottom: Logo → Subheader 1 (16px gap) → Subheader 2 (8px gap) → Carousel (32px gap) → Buttons (24px gap)
- Remove excessive whitespace between elements

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Subheader 1: "AI-powered, community-driven." - font-weight: 600 (semi-bold), font-size: 20px, directly under logo
- Subheader 2: "Your driving, rewarded." - font-weight: 600 (semi-bold), font-size: 20px, 8px below subheader 1
- Both subheaders: color: #ffffff, text-align: center, letter-spacing: 0.5px

BACKGROUND:
- Reduce overall brightness by 30% - darken red (#9d1b30) and purple (#6b46c1)
- Add CSS noise/grain texture: filter overlay with opacity 0.05 for subtle grain effect
- Wavy S-curve gradient using: background: radial-gradient(ellipse at top left, #9d1b30 0%, #c41e3a 20%, rgba(255,107,53,0.2) 40%, #8b5cf6 70%, #6b46c1 100%)
- Remove orange dominance - reduce to 20% opacity accent only
- Lower backdrop blur: backdrop-filter: blur(4px) instead of heavy blur
- Make gradient flow in organic S-wave pattern, not linear diagonal

CAROUSEL/FEATURE CARDS:
- NO visible corners - use border-radius: 32px with overflow: hidden
- Soft gradient blend edges: box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.4), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
- Glass morphism: background: rgba(255,255,255,0.08), backdrop-filter: blur(12px)
- Seamless blend into background - semi-transparent with soft glow
- Border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.12)
- Dynamic depth with layered shadows

CAROUSEL NAVIGATION:
- Replace large triangles with minimal design
- Single active dot (8px circle, #10b981, centered)
- Small chevrons on either side: < • > using 12px icons or Unicode characters
- Inactive dots: 6px circles, rgba(255,255,255,0.3)
- Total navigation height: 24px max
- Position: 16px below carousel cards, centered

BUTTONS:
- "Get Started": background: #10b981, border-radius: 16px, font-weight: 600, width: 80%, max-width: 400px
- "I Already Have an Account": background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1), border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2), border-radius: 16px
- Button height: 56px
- Gap between buttons: 16px
- Center both buttons horizontally

ROUTING:
