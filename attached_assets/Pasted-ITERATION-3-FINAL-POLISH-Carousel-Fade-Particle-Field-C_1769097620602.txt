   - Size: 280px width (maintain hero treatment)
   - Position: Center-aligned, 48px from top of safe area
   - High-res: 2x scaling for Retina
   - Margin below: 16px (tighter spacing to subheader)

2. NEW SUBHEADER TEXT + POSITIONING:
   - Text: "AI-powered. Community-driven. Your driving, rewarded."
   - Position: Directly beneath Driiva logo (16px gap)
   - Styling:
     • font-size: 16px

     • color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)
     • text-align: center
     • letter-spacing: 0.3px
     • line-height: 1.4
   - Margin below: 48px before cards

3. SINGLE-CARD CAROUSEL WITH FADE TRANSITIONS:
   - Display: ONE card visible at a time (full width minus padding)
   - Card container:
     • Position: Centered vertically in remaining viewport space
     • Width: calc(100% - 48px) — 24px padding each side
     • Max-width: 380px
     • Height: 200px
     • Overflow: hidden (no scroll indicators)
   
   - Swipe Interaction:
     • Implement touch/swipe gesture detection
     • On swipe left: Fade out current card (opacity 1 → 0, 300ms)
       Then fade in next card (opacity 0 → 1, 300ms)
     • On swipe right: Same fade pattern to previous card
     • Use CSS transitions: transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out
   
   - Navigation Indicators:
     • Add 3 small dots below card (24px gap)
     • Dot size: 8px diameter
     • Active dot: rgba(0, 217, 160, 0.9)
     • Inactive dots: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)
     • Spacing: 12px between dots
   
   - Card Order:
     1. Track Your Driving (chart icon)
     2. Earn Refunds (wallet icon)
     3. Unlock Rewards (trophy icon)

4. PARTICLE FIELD ENHANCEMENT:
   - Quantity: 16-20 dots (up from 8-12)
   - Size: 2-4px diameter (down from 4-8px)
   - Colors: Mix of:
     • rgba(0, 217, 160, 0.12) — teal
     • rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08) — white
     • rgba(120, 100, 255, 0.1) — purple hint
   
   - MULTI-DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT:
     • Create 4 animation variants:
       1. Float up + drift left (duration: 25-35s)
       2. Float up + drift right (duration: 30-40s)
       3. Float down + drift left (duration: 28-38s)
       4. Float down + drift right (duration: 32-42s)
     • Use both translateX(-50px to 50px) and translateY(-100px to 100px)
     • Randomly assign animation to each dot
     • Stagger animation-delay: 0s to -20s for continuous movement
     • Animation timing: ease-in-out for organic feel
   
   - Positioning:
     • Random placement across viewport (10% to 90% width/height)
     • Layer: z-index: 1 (between background and content)
     • Use absolute positioning

5. VERTICAL CENTERING:
   - Card carousel should sit in vertical center of space between:
     • Bottom of subheader text
     • Top of CTA buttons
   - Use flexbox or calculated margin to achieve perfect center

6. PRESERVE:
   - All button functionality ("Get Started" / "I Already Have an Account")
   - Glass-morphism card styling (0.06 opacity)
   - Radial blur on background
   - Contrast reduction filter (0.92)
   - All touch handlers on buttons

LAYOUT FLOW (TOP TO BOTTOM):
1. Driiva logo (Driiva-Logo-2.0.jpg) — 280px wide
2. Subheader: "AI-powered. Community-driven. Your driving, rewarded." — 16px below logo
3. [Flexible vertical space]
4. CENTERED single-card carousel with fade transitions
5. Navigation dots (3 indicators)
6. [Flexible vertical space]
7. CTA buttons (stacked)

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Use CSS transforms only for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Implement will-change: transform, opacity on animated elements
- Use requestAnimationFrame for swipe gesture detection
- Particle animations via CSS keyframes (not JS)
- Preload both logo files for instant render
- Touch-action: pan-y to prevent scroll jank

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Add aria-label="Carousel navigation" to dot indicators
- aria-live="polite" on card transitions
- Swipeable with keyboard arrows (left/right keys)
- Reduced motion: @media (prefers-reduced-motion) stops particle animations

DELIVERABLE:
Production-ready onboarding experience that ships immediately. This is the final iteration before user testing.
