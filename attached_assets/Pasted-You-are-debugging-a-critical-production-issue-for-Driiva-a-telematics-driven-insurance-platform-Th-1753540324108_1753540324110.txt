You are debugging a critical production issue for Driiva, a telematics-driven insurance platform. The app shows "Your app is not running" despite a functional backend. Follow this systematic debugging approach:

**PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSIS (2 minutes)**
1. Check build errors: Run `npm run build` and capture ALL error messages
2. Verify package.json scripts: Ensure start script points to correct entry point
3. Check port conflicts: Confirm frontend and backend aren't competing for port 5000
4. Inspect browser console: Look for JavaScript errors, failed resource loads, CORS issues

**PHASE 2: SYSTEMATIC COMPONENT ANALYSIS (3 minutes)**
1. Authentication Flow:
   - Verify sign-in component renders without crashing
   - Check localStorage/sessionStorage for auth tokens
   - Test default credentials (driiva1/driiva1) from logs
   
2. Dashboard Components:
   - Isolate each dashboard component individually
   - Test API connectivity: `/api/dashboard/8` and `/api/trips/8/*` endpoints
   - Verify data parsing and state management

3. CSS/Styling Pipeline:
   - Check if CSS files are being served (network tab)
   - Verify Tailwind/CSS framework configuration
   - Test component styling in isolation

**PHASE 3: TARGETED FIXES (5 minutes)**
Execute fixes in this priority order:
1. **Build Issues**: Fix any compilation errors in package.json, tsconfig.json, or webpack config
2. **Route Configuration**: Ensure React Router is correctly configured for `/` and `/dashboard` routes  
3. **API Integration**: Fix any fetch/axios calls causing frontend crashes
4. **CSS Loading**: Resolve stylesheet import/loading issues
5. **Component Logic**: Fix any React hooks or state management causing render failures

**PHASE 4: VALIDATION (2 minutes)**
1. Restart development server completely
2. Test sign-in flow with credentials driiva1/driiva1
3. Verify dashboard loads with user data
4. Confirm API calls display correctly in UI
5. Test responsive design and styling

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Preview shows login page (not "app not running")
- Authentication works with default credentials  
- Dashboard displays user data from API calls
- All components render with proper styling
- No console errors or failed network requests
