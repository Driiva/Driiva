Make ALL entry points use the SAME dashboard experience that currently works on "Test Driiva" button, but add proper onboarding flow for new signups.

CURRENT WORKING STATE (Demo Mode):
- Dashboard at /dashboard shows:
  ✅ Policy Status (Comprehensive Telematics, DRV-2025-000001)
  ✅ Driving Score: 82/100 with gradient circle
  ✅ GPS Location map with dark CartoDB tiles, London marker
  ✅ Your Trips section (Home → Office: 92, Office → Grocery: 88)
  ✅ Community Pool (£105,000 total, £62.50 share, 85% safety factor)
  ✅ Achievements & Goals section
  ✅ Refund Goals progress bar
- Trips page shows detailed trip cards with Braking/Acceleration/Speed metrics
- Profile shows user account details

ROUTING LOGIC:

1. "Get Started" button → /signup page
   - User fills signup form (email, password, name, phone, car details)
   - After successful account creation → redirect to /onboarding
   
2. /onboarding flow (NEW USERS ONLY):
   - Step 1: Enable GPS permissions (browser location access)
   - Step 2: Install Driiva app prompt (or "Continue in browser")
   - Step 3: Quick tutorial ("Track trips to earn refunds")
   - After onboarding complete → redirect to /dashboard
   - Dashboard shows EMPTY state initially:
     * No trips yet ("Start driving to see your first trip!")
     * Default score: 0/100 or "Building your score..."
     * GPS map shows their current location
     * Community pool visible (£0 share until first trip)

3. "Test Driiva" button → /dashboard in demo mode
   - Skip onboarding entirely
   - Auto-login with driiva1 test account
   - Shows full mock data (trips, score 82, pool share £62.50)
   
4. "I Already Have an Account" button → /login page
   - User logs in with existing credentials
   - Skip onboarding (already completed)
   - Redirect to /dashboard with their real data from Supabase

DELETE any separate demo-dashboard, test-dashboard, or duplicate dashboard pages.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH:
- ONE /dashboard component
- Shows different data based on user state:
  - Demo mode (driiva1): Mock data with trips and scores
  - New user (no trips): Empty state with GPS map enabled
  - Returning user: Real data from Supabase
- GPS map appears on ALL dashboard versions
- All trips, pool data, achievements render identically

ONBOARDING COMPONENT:
Create simple 3-step onboarding that:
- Asks for GPS permission
- Explains how Driiva works ("Drive safely, earn refunds")
- Can be skipped with "Skip for now" button
- Saves onboarding_completed = true in Supabase user profile

Navigation tabs (Home, Trips, Dashboard, Profile) work identically for all user types.

The demo version IS the production version structure. New users just start with empty data.
