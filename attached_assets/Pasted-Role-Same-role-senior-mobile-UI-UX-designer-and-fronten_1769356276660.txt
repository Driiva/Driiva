Role: Same role: senior mobile UI/UX designer and frontend engineer.
Goal: Make the green "Get Started" button navigate to a new /signup page where users can create a REAL account, not the demo. Create that signup page if it doesn't exist.
1. Update "Get Started" button routing


Find the green "Get Started" button on the homepage.


Change its href or onClick to navigate to /signup instead of whatever demo flow it's currently using.


Do NOT change the button's visual style; only the link/navigation.


2. Create /signup page for real account creation


If a signup page doesn't exist, create it at pages/signup.tsx (or equivalent path in your project structure).


Use the same glassmorphism card style as the sign-in page for visual consistency.


Include these fields:


Full Name (text input)


Email (email input)


Password (password input with eye icon to show/hide)


Confirm Password (password input)


"Create Account" button (same styling as "Sign In" button on the sign-in page)


Link at bottom: "Already have an account? Sign in" → navigates to /signin




Wire the "Create Account" button to Supabase's supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password }) method.


On successful signup, redirect new users to /onboarding.


Show clear error messages if signup fails (e.g., weak password, email already exists).


3. Background and styling consistency


Use the same driiva.png.jpeg background as the homepage and sign-in page.


Match card padding, border radius, and glassmorphism style to the sign-in page.


Files to create/modify:


Homepage component (to fix "Get Started" routing).


New pages/signup.tsx component.


Supabase client file if auth logic needs adjustment.


Constraints:


Do NOT break the existing sign-in flow or demo accounts.


Follow the same visual design system as sign-in and homepage.


Output:


Confirm "Get Started" now navigates to /signup.


List the new signup page file created and its structure.


Confirm signup flow connects to Supabase and redirects to /onboarding on success.
