Role: You are a senior mobile-first UI/UX designer and frontend engineer. You are working inside my Driiva Replit project to bring the homepage hero to production-level quality. You must respect the brand and screenshots, not improvise.

Goal: Make the homepage hero (logo, headline, background) visually match the TYPE B screenshots, using driiva.png.jpeg as the background, while fixing the issues shown in TYPE A/C. Do not touch auth logic or routing.

1. Logo cropping and spacing

The logo image has too much transparent padding in the asset, which creates an ugly gap before the “AI-powered, community-driven” subheader.

Do NOT ask for a new logo file; fix this in code.

Wrap the logo <img>/<Image> in a container with overflow: hidden. Within that container:

Adjust width/height so the visible part of the logo is ~15–20% larger than in TYPE A, similar in visual weight to TYPE B.

Use object-fit, object-position, or transforms to effectively crop out the dead top/bottom space so the logo text itself sits tighter.

Target vertical spacing:

The distance from the bottom of the visible logo to the subheader (“AI-powered, community-driven”) should be about 12–16px on a ~390px wide mobile viewport, like in TYPE B.

Ensure the logo is horizontally centered and remains sharp on Retina mobile screens.

2. Hero background using driiva.png.jpeg

Use the attached driiva.png.jpeg image as the actual hero background.

Import it and apply as a full-screen background behind the hero content, for example:

A top-level <div> with background-image: url(...), background-size: cover, background-position: center, and min-height: 100vh on the hero section; or

An absolutely positioned <img>/<Image> behind the hero content with object-fit: cover, inset-0, and proper z-index.

Do NOT recreate the gradient from scratch or change the palette. The colors should visually match driiva.png.jpeg.

Make sure this background scales nicely on tall mobile screens without obvious stretching or tiling.

3. Soft floating orb animation (subtle)

Add 1–3 subtle blurred orb elements on top of the driiva.png.jpeg background but behind the hero content.

Implementation guidelines:

Use simple CSS keyframes for slow movement (18–30s per loop).

Keep them low opacity and heavily blurred so they just add depth.

Colors must be sampled from the driiva.png.jpeg palette (warm oranges/reds and deep purples) so they blend naturally.

Ensure text and icons remain legible; if an orb conflicts with text, reposition it.

4. Mobile responsiveness & structure

On a ~390px-wide viewport:

No horizontal scroll.

Hero content (logo, subheader, card, carousel, buttons) should be vertically stacked and centered similar to TYPE B.

Ensure padding at top/bottom feels balanced, with the logo clearly visible on first load.

5. Files and structure

Identify and modify the actual hero files, for example (update paths to real ones):

client/src/pages/index.tsx or client/src/app/page.tsx – main homepage.

client/src/components/Logo.tsx – logo component.

Any CSS/Tailwind modules that control hero background and layout.

Keep the existing text, copy, and buttons. Only adjust visuals, layout, and background.

Constraints:

Do NOT modify Supabase code, auth flows, or routes. Only hero visuals.

When TYPE A vs TYPE B differ, always match TYPE B, using driiva.png.jpeg as the background source of truth.

Output:

List each file you changed.

For each file, briefly describe:

How you adjusted the logo cropping and spacing.

How you wired in driiva.png.jpeg as the hero background.

How you implemented and positioned the orb animation.

Confirm the logo–subheader gap on mobile is within ~12–16px.
