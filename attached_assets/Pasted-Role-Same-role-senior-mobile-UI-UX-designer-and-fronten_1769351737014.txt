Role: Same role: senior mobile UI/UX designer and frontend engineer. Now refine the homepage hero content (card, buttons, secondary CTA) to feel like a polished telematics/fintech app, matching TYPE B.
Goal: Resize the hero card and buttons, restore the missing middle CTA between the carousel and “See Driiva”, and align overall spacing with TYPE B. Do not break auth or navigation.
1. Hero card (“Unlock Rewards”) sizing and feel


Use TYPE B (dashboard and previous hero) as the visual reference.


Reduce internal padding of the hero card by around 20% compared to TYPE A so it feels lighter and less blocky.


Maintain a glassmorphism look:


Slightly transparent dark background.


Soft border and subtle shadow.


Optional small background blur if performance is acceptable.




Make sure title, icon, and body text follow a clean hierarchy (title > description > icon), with consistent vertical spacing.


2. Buttons: size and styling


Target button height on mobile: 44–48px. Avoid huge pill buttons that eat vertical space.


“See Driiva” button:


Style as a primary action on the hero: deep, slightly metallic/radiant blue that feels modern but not neon.


Full-width or nearly full-width, centered, with rounded corners similar to TYPE B.




“I Already Have an Account” button:


Style as a tertiary action: transparent or outline variant with the same border radius and typography.


Maintain enough contrast for accessibility.




3. Restore and position the green middle CTA


Bring back the second CTA button that used to live between the carousel and “See Driiva” in the earlier design. Think of it as a “Get Started” or main onboarding CTA.


Use this exact vertical order in the JSX/DOM and visually:


Logo


Subheader text (“AI-powered, community-driven…”)


Hero card (“Unlock Rewards”)


Carousel (dots/arrows)


Green “Get Started” CTA (restored middle CTA)


“See Driiva” button (blue)


“I Already Have an Account” button (secondary/tertiary)




Style this restored CTA with a subtle green gradient that feels consistent with the “Demo Mode” badge from TYPE B:


Calm, trustworthy green; not neon.


Same size and border radius as “See Driiva”, but higher prominence than “I Already Have an Account”.




4. Interaction feel


Add subtle press/hover states for all three CTAs:


On press: 2–3% scale down and a slight darkening of background color.


No heavy drop shadows, glows, or bouncy animations. The feel should be calm and premium.




5. Files and structure


Modify the homepage component that defines the hero card, carousel, and buttons.


If shared Button or Card components are used, adjust them so changes improve the whole app while staying consistent with the dashboard in TYPE B.


Constraints:


Do NOT change any text copy, URLs, or auth logic. Only layout, styling, and component composition.


When TYPE A vs TYPE B conflict, match TYPE B for polish and proportions.


Output:


Show the final JSX structure (hierarchy) for the hero section, from logo down to “I Already Have an Account”.


Summarise how card padding and button sizes changed relative to TYPE A.
