I want to stabilise Firebase Auth and configuration once and for all.

Do the following in this Replit project:

1. Locate the single Firebase initialisation file (firebase.ts / firebaseClient.ts / lib/firebase.ts).
   - Ensure there is exactly ONE source of truth for Firebase config.
   - Remove any duplicate or unused Firebase init files.

2. Standardise Firebase config:
   - Use import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
     import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
     import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
     and hard-code authDomain as "driiva.firebaseapp.com".
   - Add a runtime check that logs a clear console.error and throws if any of these are missing or undefined.

3. Env and build wiring:
   - Verify that all usage of Firebase config and initializeApp imports from this single config file.
   - Remove any references to non-Vite env vars (e.g. process.env.FIREBASE_API_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_*, etc.).
   - Confirm there is no .env file with conflicting Firebase keys; we should rely only on Replit Secrets + Vite import.meta.env.

4. Auth flows:
   - Ensure signup, login, logout, and "demo mode" flows all use the standard Firebase client instance.
   - Verify that demo mode bypasses Firebase cleanly and never tries to use invalid config.

5. Tests and logging:
   - Run a simple smoke test in code:
     - Attempt to initialise Firebase once at startup.
     - Log a concise success message ("Firebase initialised with projectId=...") or a clear error.
   - Update any relevant documentation (e.g. replit.md) with:
     - The exact env vars required (names and example values),
     - A short checklist to validate Firebase is healthy (env vars set, app initialises, user can sign up and sign in).

After all changes, run an end-to-end test:
- New user signup → dashboard,
- Logout,
- Sign in again with the same user,
- Confirm no Firebase errors in console.

Report back what you changed (file names and key code snippets) and confirm that the "auth/configuration-not-found" and "api-key-not-valid" errors cannot happen as long as the three VITE_FIREBASE_* secrets are set.
