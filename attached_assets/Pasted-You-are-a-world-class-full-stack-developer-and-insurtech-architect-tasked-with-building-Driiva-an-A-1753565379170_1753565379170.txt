You are a world-class full-stack developer and insurtech architect tasked with building Driiva, an AI-powered telematics insurance platform with premium glassmorphism UI and predictive analytics. This is a high-stakes fintech project requiring perfect execution.

**EXTENDED THINKING ACTIVATION:**
Before starting any implementation, engage your extended thinking capabilities to:
1. Analyze the complete technical architecture required
2. Identify potential failure points and edge cases
3. Plan the optimal development sequence
4. Consider scalability and production readiness

**CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING FRAMEWORK:**

**PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS (Think Step-by-Step)**
Let me break down this complex insurtech platform systematically:

1. **Core Business Logic Understanding:**
   - Personal driving score (80% weight) + Community score (20% weight) = Total qualification score
   - 70+ total score qualifies for refunds (up to 15% of annual premium)
   - AI predictive analytics for risk assessment and refund projections
   - Telematics data processing for real-time driving behavior analysis

2. **Technical Stack Assessment:**
   - Backend: Node.js/Express with RESTful API architecture
   - Frontend: React with glassmorphism UI and parallax scrolling
   - Database: Mock data structure (production-ready for PostgreSQL integration)
   - AI Integration: Predictive analytics and insights generation
   - UI/UX: Premium fintech aesthetic with accessibility compliance

3. **Key Differentiators to Implement:**
   - Glassmorphism design system (backdrop-filter, transparency layers)
   - Smooth parallax scrolling with multi-layer backgrounds
   - AI-powered insights dashboard with predictive refund calculations
   - Community-driven scoring algorithm
   - Real-time trip analysis and scoring

**PHASE 2: SYSTEMATIC IMPLEMENTATION (Step-by-Step Development)**

**Step 1: Backend Architecture Setup**
Think through the API structure:
- Authentication endpoint (/api/auth/login)
- User dashboard data (/api/dashboard/:userId)  
- Trip history (/api/trips/:userId)
- AI insights endpoint (/api/insights/:userId) - NEW
- Error handling and validation middleware

**Step 2: Frontend Component Architecture**
Break down the UI components systematically:
- LoginScreen (glassmorphism authentication)
- Dashboard (main interface with score cards)
- ScoreCards (personal, community, refund prediction)
- TripList (recent driving sessions)
- AIInsights (predictive analytics panel)
- ParallaxBackground (multi-layer animated backgrounds)

**Step 3: Glassmorphism Implementation Strategy**
Consider the visual hierarchy:
- Primary glass containers (main cards): rgba(255,255,255,0.15) with 20px blur
- Secondary glass elements (trip items): rgba(255,255,255,0.12) with 15px blur
- Interactive states (hover effects): increased opacity and glow
- Border treatments: subtle white borders with transparency
- Shadow systems: layered box-shadows for depth

**Step 4: AI Integration Logic**
Think through the predictive algorithms:
- Risk trend analysis (decreasing/stable/increasing)
- Refund prediction based on trajectory
- Community ranking calculations
- Sustainability scoring (CO₂ impact)
- Personalized recommendations engine

**PHASE 3: CODE IMPLEMENTATION**

Now, let me implement this step-by-step, ensuring each component works perfectly:
