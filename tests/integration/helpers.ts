/**
 * Shared setup for the Auth+Firestore integration suite (M1 T5).
 *
 * Unlike tests/rules/helpers.ts (Firestore-only, @firebase/rules-unit-testing,
 * synthetic pre-authenticated contexts), this suite drives the REAL Firebase
 * Admin and client SDKs against the auth(9099)/firestore(8080) emulators
 * declared in firebase.json, to prove T1's provisioning logic and T2's
 * owner-gated completion write end to end - not a rules simulation.
 *
 * Requires the Auth+Firestore emulators running on 127.0.0.1, see the
 * `test:integration` script in package.json, which boots them via
 * `firebase emulators:exec`.
 *
 * MODULE-INSTANCE NOTE: this suite imports `provisionUser` directly from
 * functions/src/triggers/provisionUserOnSignup.ts, which itself does
 * `import * as admin from 'firebase-admin'` - resolved from
 * functions/node_modules (v12.7.0), not the root's firebase-admin (v13.7.0,
 * see package.json). Those are two independent module registries with their
 * own `getApps()` list, so initializing the root-resolved admin would leave
 * provisionUserOnSignup.ts's own `getFirestore()` call throwing "no
 * default app". vitest.integration.config.ts aliases the bare `firebase-admin`
 * specifier to the functions/ copy for every file in this suite, so this
 * helper's `admin` import and the one inside provisionUserOnSignup.ts resolve
 * to the exact same module and share one initialized app - PROVIDED this
 * module is imported (and so runs its top-level initializeApp side effect)
 * before provisionUserOnSignup.ts. identity.test.ts imports this module
 * first for that reason; `getFirestore()` runs at provisionUserOnSignup.ts's
 * own module top level, so a lazily-deferred init here (e.g. inside a
 * beforeAll) would run too late.
