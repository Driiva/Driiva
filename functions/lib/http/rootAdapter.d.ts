/**
 * ROOT ADAPTER - typed interface seam over the Root Platform HTTP integration
 * ============================================================================
 * M4 Task 4 (structural seam only, per .superpowers/sdd/m4-plan/task-4-brief.md
 * and m4-grounding.md section 4): extracts the quote/bind/sync/cancel
 * operations that `insurance.ts` already models behind a typed `RootAdapter`
 * interface, with `RootHttpAdapter` as the sole concrete implementation.
 *
 * IMPORTANT - this is NOT a functional fix:
 *  - No Root sandbox credentials exist (Doppler check failed this session,
 *    treat as unavailable). The HTTP calls below are exactly as unverified as
 *    they were before this refactor - do not read this file as evidence the
 *    Root integration works end to end.
 *  - D15 (Root/FCA operating model) is unconfirmed. `RootHttpAdapter.cancel`
 *    in particular has no prior live call to preserve behaviour from (no
 *    cancellation primitive existed anywhere pre-M4 - see grounding section
 *    2/4) - it is new, modelled on the same PATCH pattern the rest of this
 *    file already uses, and is exactly as unverified as everything else here.

/**
 * PINNED DECISION (ZAR-vs-GBP, from insurance.ts / m4-grounding.md sections 2
 * and 4; tracked as ROADMAP.md TD-4):
 * Root's sandbox models all monetary values in ZAR cents. Driiva is a UK GBP
 * product. There is currently NO conversion applied anywhere in this module -
 * `rootQuote.suggested_premium` / `monthly_premium` etc. are passed straight
 * through as if they were GBP pence. This function exists so that mismatch has
 * one named, greppable location instead of being silently baked into every
 * call site. Do NOT invent a conversion rate here - a real one requires either
 * (a) confirming Root's UK/GBP product module key once sandbox creds exist, or
 * (b) an explicit FX rate signed off as part of D15. Until then this is an
 * identity function that returns its input unchanged, so behaviour is
 * unchanged from pre-seam code - it just makes the gap impossible to miss.
