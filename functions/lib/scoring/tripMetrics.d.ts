/**
 * TRIP METRICS
 * ============
 * Ported verbatim from `functions/src/utils/helpers.ts:224-489` (the
 * `computeTripMetrics` algorithm and its private helpers) plus
 * `shared/tripProcessor.ts:23` (`haversineMeters`, the distance dependency).
 * Byte-faithful to current behaviour: do NOT "fix" or refactor any logic
 * here. See the M0 Task 2 report for characterisation evidence and any
 * bugs spotted but intentionally left unchanged.
 *
 * ONE deliberate exception to that freeze: phone-usage wiring (M2-DEC-1
 * Option A, docs/rebuild/m2-dec-1-phone-usage.md). `computeTripMetrics` took
 * a second, optional `clientReportedPhonePickupCount` parameter so the 10%
 * phone-usage weight (SCORE_WEIGHTS.phoneUsage below) can score something
 * other than a permanent, undisclosed 100. See `sanitizePhonePickupCount`
 * for what "wired" means here: a client-reported number the server
 * sanity-checks and rate-caps, not an independently verified one - there is
 * no server-side accelerometer stream to check it against. Everything else
 * in this file is still the frozen, byte-faithful port.
 *
 * `TripEvents` / `TripMetrics` mirror `functions/src/types.ts` `TripEvents`
 * / `ComputedTripMetrics` field-for-field. @driiva/contracts does not yet
 * define these shapes, so they are declared locally per the brief.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE AUTHORED SOURCE. `functions/src/scoring/tripMetrics.ts`
 * is a build-time copy (see functions/package.json `prebuild`, which `cp`s
 * this file over it) - edit here, then sync that copy by hand if you are not
 * running the functions build.

 * phonePickup.ts); the web surface additionally counts a tab switch, because
 * browsers stop delivering devicemotion to a page that is not visible, and
 * debounces the two together so one act is one pickup. See the call sites in
 * functions/src/triggers/trips.ts and each client for what "pickup" means on
 * that platform. It is sanitised via `sanitizePhonePickupCount` before it
 * can influence `events.phonePickupCount` or the score, because it is client
 * input the server has no independent way to verify.
