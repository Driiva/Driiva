/**
 * Triggered when a new user document is created in Firestore.
 *
 * Actions:
 *   1. Checks if the user already has an active policy (idempotency)
 *   2. Creates a default 'pending' policy with standard coverage
 *   3. Links the policy reference back to the user document
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Policy status starts as 'pending' (not 'active') until payment/quote is confirmed
 *   - Premium defaults to 0 cents until a quote is generated
 *   - Uses integer cents for all financial fields (never floats)
